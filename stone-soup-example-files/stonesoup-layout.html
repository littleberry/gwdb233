			<h2 class="section-sub-title">An Old Tale Retold</h2>
			<h3>Text by Marcia Brown</h3>
			
			<p>
			Three soldiers trudged down a road in a strange country. They were on their way home from the wars. Besides being tired, they were hungry. In fact, they had eaten nothing for two days. "How I would like a good dinner tonight,” said the first. “And a bed to sleep in,” said the second.
			</p>
			<p>
			“But all that is impossible,” said the third. “We must march on.”
			</p>
			<p>
			On they marched. Suddenly, ahead of them they saw the lights of a village.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Maybe we’ll find a bite to eat there,” said the first.
			</p>
			<p>
			“And a loft to sleep in,” said the second.
			</p>
			<p>
			“No harm in asking,” said the third.
			</p>
			<p>
			Now the peasants of that place feared strangers. When they heard that three soldiers were coming down the road, they talked among themselves. 
			</p>
			<p>
			“Here come three soldiers. Soldiers are always hungry. But we have little enough for ourselves.” And they hurried to hide their food. They pushed the sacks of barley under the hay in the lofts. They lowered buckets of milk down the wells.
			</p>
			<p>
			They spread old quilts over the carrot bins. They hid their cabbages and potatoes under the beds. They hung their meat in the cellars.
			</p>
			<p>
			They hid all they had to eat. Then – they waited. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The soldiers stopped first at the house of Paul and Francoise.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Good evening to you,” they said. “Could you spare a bit of food for three hungry soldiers?”
			</p>
			<p>
			“We have had no food for ourselves for three days,” said Paul. Francoise made a sad face. “It has been a poor harvest.”
			</p>
			<p>
			The three soldiers went on the house of Albert and Louise.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Could you spare a bit of food? And have you some corner where we could sleep for the night?”
			</p>
			<p>
			“Oh no,” said Albert. “We gave all we could spare to soldiers who came before you.”
			</p>
			<p>
			“Our beds are full,” said Louise. 
			</p>
			<p>
			At Vincent and Marie’s the answer was the same.  It had been a poor harvest and all the grain must be kept for seed. So it went all through the village. Not a peasant had any food to give away. They all had good reasons. One family had use the grain for feed. Another had an old sick father to care for. All had too many mouths to fill.
			</p>
			<p>
			The villagers stood in the street and sighed. The looked as hungry as they could. The three soldiers talked together.
			</p>
			<p>
			Then the first soldier called out, “Good people!” The peasants drew near.
			</p>
			<p>
			“We are three hungry soldiers in a strange land. We have asked you for food and you have no food. Well then, we’ll have to make stone soup.”
			</p>
			<p>
			The peasants stared.
			</p>
			<p>
			Stone soup? That would be something to know about. 
			</p>
			<p>
			“First, we’ll need a large iron pot,” the soldiers said. The peasants brought the largest pot they could find. How else to cook enough?
			</p>
			<p>
			“That's none too large,” said the soldiers. “But it will do. And now, water to fill it and a fire to heat it.” 
			</p>
			<p>
			It took many buckets of water to fill the pot. A fire was built on the village square and the pot was set to boil. “And now,  if you please, three round, smooth stones.”
			</p>
			<p>
			Those were easy enough to find.
			</p>
			<p>
			The peasants’ eyes grew round as they watched the soldiers drop the stones into the pot. 
			</p>
			<p>
			“Any soup needs salt and pepper,” said the soldiers, as they began to stir. Children ran to fetch salt and pepper.
			</p>
			<p>
			“Stones like these generally make good soup. But oh, if there were carrots, it would be much better.”
			</p>
			<p>
			“Why, I think I have a carrot or two,” said Francoise, and off she ran.
			</p>
			<p>
			She came back with her apron fill of carrots from the bin beneath the red quilt.
			</p>
			<p>
			“A good stone soup should have cabbage,” said the soldiers as they sliced the carrots into the pot. “But no use asking for what you don't have.”
			</p>
			<p>
			“I think I could find a cabbage somewhere,” said Marie and she hurried home. Back she came with three cabbages from the cupboard under the bed. 
			</p>
			<p>
			“If we only had a bit of beef and a few potatoes, this soup would be good enough for a rich man's table” The peasants thought that over. They remembered their potatoes and the sides of beef hanging in the cellars. They ran to fetch them.
			</p>
			<p>
			A rich man's soup – and all from a few stones. It seemed like magic! 
			</p>
			<p>
			“Ah,” sighed the soldiers as they stirred in the beef and potatoes, “if we only had a little barley and a cup of milk! This would would be fit for the king himself. Indeed he asked for just such a soup when last he dined with us.” The peasants looked at each other. The soldiers had entertained the king! Well!
			</p>
			<p>
			“But – no use asking for what you don’t have,” the soldiers signed.
			</p>
			<p>
			The peasants brought their barley from the lofts, they brought their milk from the wells. The soldiers stirred the barley and milk into the steaming broth while the peasants stared. 
			</p>
			<p>
			At last the soup was ready. “All of you shall taste,” the soldiers said. “But first a table must be set.”
			</p>
			<p>
			Great tables were placed in the square. And all around were lighted torches.
			</p>
			<p>
			Such a soup! How good it smelled! Truly fit for a king.
			</p>
			<p>
			But then the peasants asked themselves, “Would not such a soup require bread – and a roast – and cider?” Soon a banquet was spread and everyone sat down to eat.
			</p>
			<p>
			Never had there been such a feast. Never had the peasants tasted such soup. And fancy, made from stones! 
			</p>
			<p>
			They ate and drank and ate and drank. And after that they danced. They danced and sang far into the night. 
			</p>
			<p>
			At last they were tired. Then the three soldiers asked, “Is there not a loft where we could sleep?” “Let three such wise and splendid gentlemen sleep in a loft? Indeed! They must have the best beds in the village.” 
			</p>
			<p>
			So the first soldier slept in the priest’s house. The second soldier slept in the baker’s house. And the third soldier slept in the mayor’s house. 
			</p>
			<p>
			In the morning, the whole village gathered in the square to give them a send-off. “Many thanks for what you have taught us,” the peasants said to the soldiers. “We shall never go hungry, now that we know how to make soup from stones.” 
			</p>
			<p>
			“Oh, it’s all in knowing how,” said the soldiers, and off they went down the road.

			<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup">Stone Soup is an old folk story in which hungry strangers trick the local people of a town into sharing their food: a good confidence trick that benefits the group from combining their individual resources. The story is usually told as a lesson in cooperation, especially amid scarcity. In varying traditions, the stone has been replaced with other common inedible objects, and therefore the fable is also known as button soup, wood soup, nail soup, and axe soup. It is Aarne-Thompson tale type 1548.</blockquote>
			
			<h3>Story</h3>
			<p>
			Some travellers come to a village, carrying nothing more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are unwilling to share any of their food stores with the hungry travellers. Then the travellers go to a stream and fill the pot with water, drop a large stone in it, and place it over a fire. One of the villagers becomes curious and asks what they are doing. The travellers answer that they are making "stone soup", which tastes wonderful, although it still needs a little bit of garnish to improve the flavour, which they are missing. The villager does not mind parting with a few carrots to help them out, so that gets added to the soup. Another villager walks by, inquiring about the pot, and the travellers again mention their stone soup which has not reached its full potential yet. The villager hands them a little bit of seasoning to help them out. More and more villagers walk by, each adding another ingredient. Finally, a delicious and nourishing pot of soup is enjoyed by all.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Variations</h3>
			<p>
				In the Portuguese tradition, the traveller is a monk and the story takes place around Almeirim, Portugal. Nowadays many restaurants in Almeirim serve stone soup, or sopa de pedra. Almeirim is considered the capital of stone soup.[citation needed]
			</p>
			<p>
			In the French and Hungarian versions of the tale, the travellers are soldiers: three returning home from the Napoleonic Wars play the role in the former, and a single, starving one, who encounters several hardships on his journey back to his homeland, is depicted in the latter.
			</p>
			<p>
			The story is most commonly known as nail soup in Scandinavian and Northern European countries. In these versions, the main character is typically a tramp looking for food and lodgings, who convinces an old woman that he will make nail soup for the both of them if she would just add a few ingredients for the garnish. In Eastern Europe the variation of the story (having more in common with the Northern European rendition) is called axe soup, with an axe being the catalyst. In Russian tradition a soldier eats axe kasha (Каша из топора).
			</p>
			
			<h3>Historical references</h3>
			<p>
				U.S. Army General George S. Patton, Jr. referred to the "rock soup method" of acquiring resources for attacks in the face of official disapproval by his superiors for offensive operations. In the military context, he sent units forward ostensibly on reconnaissance missions, to later reinforce them when resistance was met and eventually turned small scale probes into all out attacks; he notably did this during the Battle of Sicily in the advance on Palermo and again in the campaign in northwest Europe, notably near Metz when his 3rd US Army was officially halted during Operation Market Garden.[1]
			</p>
			<p>
				There are many examples of projects referencing the Stone Soup story's theme of making something significant by accumulating lots of small contributions. Examples include the Stone Soup the magazine by children, the Stone Soupercomputer, the Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup computer game which expanded on an abandoned project using contributions from many different coders and the Stone Soup Theater presenting one act plays.[2]
			</p>
			
			<h3>Adaptations</h3>
			<p>
				William Butler Yeats' 1904 play The Pot of Broth tells a version of the story in which a clever Irish tramp uses his wits to swindle a shrewish medieval housewife out of her dinner.[3]
			</p>
			<p>
				The story was the basis of a 1947 children's book, Stone Soup (ISBN 9780689878367), by Marcia Brown, which featured soldiers tricking miserly villages into cooking them a feast. The book was a Caldecott Honor book in 1948.[4] The book was read aloud by the Captain (played by Bob Keeshan) on an early episode of Captain Kangaroo in the 1950s, as well as at least once in the 1960s or early 1970s.[5][6]
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1968 Scholastic Book Services published "Stone Soup" (ISBN 978-0590416023) by Ann McGovern with Pictures by Nola Langner. It tells the story of a little old lady and a hungry young man at the door asking for food and he tricks her into making stone soup.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another children's book based on the story, also called Stone Soup (ISBN 978-0439339094), written by Jon J. Muth and set in China, was published in 2003.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shel Silverstein's song, "The Wonderful Soup Stone" tells a version of this story. Dr. Hook & The Medicine Show included the song on their 1973 album Belly Up!. Bobby Bare included the song on his 1973 album Lullabys, Legends and Lies.[7]
			</p>
			<p>
				The 1985 film Fandango contains a wedding sequence towards the end which builds on the Stone Soup theme. The heroes of the movie need to hold a wedding ceremony, but they lack any funds to do so. They set up a folding card table by the main street of a sleepy Texas town, dust it off, and invite passersby to come to the wedding. As they concoct stories of delinquent caterers and crashed champagne trucks, the friendly townspeople contribute their time and resources, the result being a magical wedding ceremony.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jim Henson's 1988 Storyteller series contains one tale called 'A Story Short' in which the Storyteller himself (played by John Hurt) is the main character. In the beginning, he arrives at a castle where a man is thrown out for begging for food. He proceeds to trick the King's cook into making 'Stone Soup'. After they are happily fed, the cook realizes what has happened and pleads with the King to let him boil the Storyteller in oil; but the King instead offers a way out — to tell him a story every day for a year instead.
			</p>
			<p>
				Canadian children's author Aubrey Davis adapted the story to a Jewish context in his 1996 book Bone Button Borscht. According to Davis, he wrote the story when he was unable to find a story that he liked for a Hanukkah reading.[8] A narration of Bone Button Borscht by Barbara Budd traditionally airs across Canada on CBC Radio One's As It Happens on the first day of Hanukkah.
			</p>
			<p>
				The big pool at Karl Johan street in Oslo is nicknamed Spikersuppa ('The Nail Soup') as a humorous reference to the story.

			<h2 class="section-sub-title">Using progressive enhancement to make tasty stone soup web sites</h2>
			
			<h3>Progressive enhancement</h3>
			<p>
				In the story, <i>Stone Soup</i>, a tasty soup enjoyed by the characters is created by the successive addition of ingredients. The story is a parable about working together and sharing resources to create something greater than the sum of its parts. <i>Stone Soup</i> also serves as a metaphor for using a progressive enhancement philosophy towards creating a usable, flexible, and responsive web site.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the story, a character passing through, is looking for something to eat. The traveller stops at a village or farm house and asks the resident for food. The resident refuses, claiming to have nothing to offer. The traveller then offers to make stone soup for the resident. Here is where our metaphor starts. The traveller sets up water in a pot over a cooking fire and, with great show, adds a stone to the pot. These four elements represent the four basic components for viewing a web page:
				
				<ul>
					<li>The user agent or browser is the pot that holds the page</li>
					<li>The context--the circumstances the page is viewed in--is the fire that cooks the page</li>
					<li>The HTML and its semantics are the water for the soup</li>
					<li>The content is the stone and the basis for the soup</li>
				</ul>
				
				<blockquote>Boil stones in butter, and you may sip the broth. <i>-English Proverb</i></blockquote>
			</p>
			<p>
				At this point, the soup doesn't taste like much, nor does a web page look like much. Yet they are minimally consumable.
